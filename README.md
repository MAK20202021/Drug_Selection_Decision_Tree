# Drug_Selection_Decision_Tree

The main goal is to find the right model to select the right drug for future patient depending upon the demographic features of the dataset. 

Then we have focused on the train and test splitting of the data set to evaluate the model accurately with the test set. Cross validation and Grid search can provide us more accurate model by tunning hyperparameters.
