# Drug_Selection_Decision_Tree

The main goal is to find the right model to select the appropriate drug for future patient with the same illness depending upon the demographic features of the dataset. This dataset is about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y. The features of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and the Cholesterol of the patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.
It is a sample of multiclass classifier, and we can use the training part of the dataset to build a decision tree, and then use it to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to prescribe a drug to a new patient.
